## MegaOS - Operating System ðŸ”§

>Status: Development Paused

**THIS WAS JUST 4FUN, I MADE THIS IN 2016 (I WAS 11)**

Everything that is here should not be taken seriously, the code probably has several flaws and things that could and should be improved.

However, I was only 11 when I did this, and it was all done in Visual Basic.NET.

I posted this here because I think it's cool to look back and see the things that I was developing, or thought I was. 'Cause in truth most part of this was pasted from youtube.



**With MegaOS you can:**

- Change your Wallpaper (We have default wallpapers, but you can customize with every image that you want)
- Navegate in the Internet with our Browser, the PowerPlus (I couldn't come up with a better name, sorry)
- Change the color of the Taskbar


I don't think I'm gonna update this on the future, but who knows?
